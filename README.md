#### Basic Project Info

- package and dependency management tool - Poetry
- VCS - git
- major [pre-commit hooks](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) for formatting code
    - black
    - flake8
    - isort
- license - [MIT](./LICENSE.md)
- *main.py* - entry point for the tool [main script](canonical/main.py)
- more info under [Project TOML](./pyproject.toml)
- Approx. time invested: ~ a week and half

#### Project Description | Approach

- The task comprises primarily of two actions, which is achieved through two types of objects
    - **Downloader**:
        - check if architecture names file exists locally
            - if yes
                - then search in it and fetch the contents ✅
            - if no
                - then make a request to base URL
                - get the architecture names
                - fetch content (HTML)
                - parse (HTML) to get all URLs of gzip files
                - get arch names from them and save them locally in a txt file
                - re-check if the name exists
                    - if yes, go ahead and fetch the contents ✅
                    - if no, exit out (max attempt reached - 1) ❌
        - the above logic
            - prevents an additional (if not needed) request to server
            - faster
        - after the contents of architecture are fetched using its URL
            - get content and save as gzip locally
            - also save content as a txt (*bytes*) file for further use
    - **Parser**:
        - open the saved txt file
        - get content in right format (*bytes --> str*)
        - parse the raw text
        - process contents
            - define two dict
                - dict with packages as keys and number of files in them as values
                    - memory-efficient
                    - faster
                - dict with packages as keys and the files in them as values
                    - can also be processed and obtained, if needed (user-defined)
            - there could be four cases based on a row (2 cols- file & package)in the data
                - file and package both present
                - either one is missing (both cases handled together) --> categorised under "ungrouped data"
                    - more functionality is needed to verify if the missing element is package or file
                - both are missing --> row skipped/ignored
        - process the dict to get package stats
            - sort (default descending) the dict based on values (no of files)
            - get the top-n (default n = 10) packages
            - format the required results
            - output to console
            - also save (optional) the results in a txt file for later use
    - The above was achieved through two classes with same names
    - Corresponding directory and files
        - *modules*
            - *downloader.py*
            - *parser.py*
- To handle the cmdline functionality for running the script from cmdline, to get the architecture from user and other
  options, a separate script was written
    - two main functions
        - function *args_parser*
            - sets up the *argparse.Namespace* for cmdline arguments
            - two arguments - positional *arch* and optional *verbose*
            - validates the *arch* argument
            - returns the *Namespace*
        - function *validate_arch*
            - validates the *arch* argument from cmdline
            - basis for validation - purely numeric architecture names do not exist (till now)
            - if validated, returns the lowercase value of *arch*
    - Corresponding directory and file
        - *modules*
            - *cmdline_parser.py*
- Logging for the whole project is handled through a logger, defined separately once
    - root logger and subsequent use in different modules
    - two handlers - File and Stream - with different log levels
    - logs are stored under *logs* directory
    - formatter to get relevant info
    - returns configured logger
    - Corresponding directory and file
        - *logs*
            - *log_info.log*
- Tests for some major functions were written
    - *pytest* as the testing library
    - *conftest.py* contains the required fixtures and mocks
    - Corresponding directory and file
        - *tests*
            - *test_cmdline_parser.py*
            - *test_downloader.py*
            - *test_parser.py*
        - *canonical* (root)
            - *conftest.py*
- Main script
    - *main.py* is the main script for invoking the tool from command line or running directly
    - cmdline usage
        - *python main.py {req: architecture name} {optional: verbosity}*
        - for help and usage: *python main.py -help*
